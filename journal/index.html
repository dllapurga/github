        <h2>Best Practices for Modal Design</h2>


        <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 28, 2026</time>

        <p>From Naema Baskanderi’s article regarding modal windows, I learned that they are best for applying when you want to capture a user’s attention right away, receive user input, display additional information both in or not in context. By interrupting the user’s user-flow with a pop-up modal screen, it  immediately brings their attention to the information, instructions, and action-items. They can be used to display additional information both associated with or independent from the parent page.</p>
        <p>The design of the modal window determines the user’s task completion. The following six features ensure a quality modal window experience:<br><br>1. The escape hatch should give the user a way out such as through a cancel or close button.<br><br> 2. The descriptive title provides context as to where the user was navigated or re-routed to.<br><br> 3. Buttons should be labeled with simple names or iconography to describe the action the user can take.<br><br> 4. In order to maintain context, the modal window should not be too big, but it should not be too small to the point it’s inaccessible.<br><br> 5. A lightbox effect should be used where the background is darkened to bring focus to the modal to insinuate that the parent page is temporarily disabled.<br><br> 6. Have the pop-up modal be user-initiated and don’t surprise the user with an unexpected pop-up. </p>
        <p>Overall, I do agree with all of these rules of thumb. They make the experience comfortable and intuitive for the user. The user is given the option to leave the modal window and is void of any pressures to engage with it. However, if they were to choose to interact with it, minimal text and visual language provide simple and comprehensible context for its purpose.   <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">uxplanet.org</a></p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>


        <time datetime="2026-01-17">January 17, 2026</time>
        <p>When working with forms, the ultimate objective is to minimize cognitive load, confusion, and to design for the optimal user experience. I agree with the rule of thumb that less is oftentimes more. Too many features, steps, and words deter people from wanting to interact with an interface. The way in which the information is formatted or arranged gauges how encouraged people will feel to engage with it. Being intentional with your language is also important as it can guide the user through the process for an easy interaction. </p>
        <p>One thing that I don’t 100% agree with was when the article mentioned not using multiple columns and sticking to single columns. I don’t necessarily believe that multiple columns break up a flow. I can understand the logic behind that statement, but I think columns can work without disrupting the user-experience in some cases. They section off different parts of the reading and make it easier to break down the contents. Sometimes for layout purposes, columns help in arranging aesthetics that also encourage people to engage with the interface.    <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">uxdesign.cc</a></p>
        <p>The duolingo website has a really nice website form for when one is first getting started with the program such as creating a profile or declaring their current fluency level in a chosen language. Not only is it really brief, but it uses icons and cards to make the interaction fun like a game. The instructions of each question are direct and it doesn’t ask all its questions at once. There is a progress bar at the top of the screen to give the user a gauge of how many more questions to expect, but otherwise, questions are asked one at a time and I think this does a good job in reducing cognitive load.     <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">duolingo.com</a></p>
