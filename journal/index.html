        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>


        <time datetime="2026-01-17">January 17, 2026</time>
        <p>When working with forms, the ultimate objective is to minimize cognitive load, confusion, and to design for the optimal user experience. I agree with the rule of thumb that less is oftentimes more. Too many features, steps, and words deter people from wanting to interact with an interface. The way in which the information is formatted or arranged gauges how encouraged people will feel to engage with it. Being intentional with your language is also important as it can guide the user through the process for an easy interaction. </p>
        <p>One thing that I don’t 100% agree with was when the article mentioned not using multiple columns and sticking to single columns. I don’t necessarily believe that multiple columns break up a flow. I can understand the logic behind that statement, but I think columns can work without disrupting the user-experience in some cases. They section off different parts of the reading and make it easier to break down the contents. Sometimes for layout purposes, columns help in arranging aesthetics that also encourage people to engage with the interface.    <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">uxdesign.cc</a></p>
        <p>The duolingo website has a really nice website form for when one is first getting started with the program such as creating a profile or declaring their current fluency level in a chosen language. Not only is it really brief, but it uses icons and cards to make the interaction fun like a game. The instructions of each question are direct and it doesn’t ask all its questions at once. There is a progress bar at the top of the screen to give the user a gauge of how many more questions to expect, but otherwise, questions are asked one at a time and I think this does a good job in reducing cognitive load.     <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">duolingo.com</a></p>
